**Project Description**<br>
flickalicious allows a user to view his flickr photo stream and begin exploring trails using tags associated with that image. After entering a user name, up to 9 of the user's photos are displayed in a grid. The user can view the photos and the associated tags for each of the images. To start a new trail, the user clicks on a tag on one of the photos, and new photos are loaded that are also associated with that tag. When a user clicks on a tag, the text of the tag is added to their trail list, which serves as a history for the current trail.<br>
